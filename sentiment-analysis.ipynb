    "## Why sentiment analysis? And why Amazon reviews\n",
    "<p>Sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews can be crucial for a company's profits because it allows the company to gain insight into how their products are perceived by customers. This information can be used to improve the products and make changes that will increase customer satisfaction and lead to increased sales. By understanding the sentiments expressed in customer reviews, a company can also identify common issues and address them, improving the overall customer experience and increasing the likelihood of repeat purchases. Additionally, positive reviews can be used as marketing material to attract new customers, while negative reviews can be addressed and resolved to prevent potential customers from being turned off by the company. Overall, sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews can be a valuable tool for companies looking to improve their profits.</p>"

    "Sentiment analysis is a sub-field of NLP that focuses on identifying and extracting subjective information from text. This information can be positive, negative, or neutral and is often used to measure the sentiment of a piece of text. Sentiment analysis is commonly used in a variety of applications, such as social media analysis, customer service, and market research. It can be used to identify the overall sentiment of a large group of people, as well as to analyze the sentiment of individual pieces of text.\n",
